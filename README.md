## Installation

Ensure you have [SSH configured on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)
for your machine.

Make sure you are using git in SSH mode.

```bash
git config --global url.ssh://git@github.com/.insteadOf https://github.com/
```

Ensure the `GOPRIVATE` variable is set in your local terminal:

```bash
# You can skip this step if you have direnv configured.
export GOPRIVATE=github.com/in-rich/*
```

Install the project dependencies:

```bash
go mod download
```

Make sure Docker is running, and available as a command:

```bash
docker ps -a
```

âœ… Congrats, you're ready to go!

Check your environment:

```bash
go version
# go version go1.23rc1 darwin/amd64
docker -v
# Docker version 24.0.7, build afdd53b
make -v
# GNU Make 3.81
echo $GOPRIVATE
# github.com/in-rich/*
```

## Usage

Run the server:

```bash
make run
```

Run tests:

```bash
make test
```

## For Windows Users

We recommend using a bash terminal emulator. One such example is [Git bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

You may also use [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

In both cases, make sure the dependencies you install are available under your bash
environment. This is automatic for Git Bash, but might require a separate setup
for WSL.
